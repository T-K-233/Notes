### 3.1 Printer Profile

For normal prints, use the X1C Daily profile. This is dimension-corrected.

<table><thead><tr><th></th><th width="278"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>X1C Daily</td><td>Daily use</td></tr><tr><td>X1C Strength</td><td>More wall loops, denser infill</td></tr><tr><td>X1C Random-Z</td><td>Strength with random-z seam </td></tr></tbody></table>



## 4. Printing

### 4.1 Before printing

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="When using cold plate" %}
* [ ] Remove the plate from the printer.
* [ ] Apply glue to the print area.
* [ ] Put the plate back to the printer. Make sure the edge of the plate is aligned to the guides on the printer.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="When using engineering plate" %}
* [ ] Remove the plate from the printer.
* [ ] **WARNING**: Make sure that the cold plate side is free of glue.
* [ ] Put the plate back to the printer. Make sure the edge of the plate is aligned to the guides on the printer.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}



### 4.2 Load filament

The AMS should auto-load the selected filament.



### 4.? After printing

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="When using cold plate" %}
* [ ] Remove the plate from the printer.
* [ ] Slowly lift the part from the build plate. Bending the plate a bit might help to detach.
* [ ] Remove the test extrusion patterns on the edge of the plate.
  * [ ] There are two test extrusion areas, one is near the bottom of the plate, and the other is near the top right corner of the plate.
* [ ] Observe the glue film status and re-apply the glue to the part adhesion area. If there is too much wear, wash the plate thoroughly with fresh water and re-apply the glue.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

## 5. CAD design considerations

Recommend to use [OnShape](https://www.onshape.com/en/) for modeling.
