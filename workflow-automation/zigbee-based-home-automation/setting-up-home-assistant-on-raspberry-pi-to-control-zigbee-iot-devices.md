# Setting up Home Assistant on Raspberry Pi to Control Zigbee IoT Devices



This is fairly simple and straight forward, thanks to the nice support provided by the Raspberry Pi Imager.



## Hardware Platform

An pretty old Raspberry Pi 3 B+ is used.&#x20;

Some people reported that the Zigbee dongle does not work well with USB3.0 ports due to interference, so maybe using 3 B+ with all USB 2.0 ports is a good option?



## Setting up Pi

Follow this tutorial on flashing the firmware
