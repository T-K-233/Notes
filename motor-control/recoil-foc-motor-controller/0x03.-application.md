#### DISABLED Mode

In this mode, the gate driver is not activated. The motor is disabled with three phase wires floating. The motor is free to rotate.

Any error in other mode will trigger the state machine to enter DISABLED mode. The error code can be seen in the error\_code register.

Switching from DISABLED mode to any other mode than IDLE is prohibited and will result in an error state.

#### IDLE Mode

The gate driver is activated and outputs zero or balanced output. Motor is in free spinning mode.

Upon entering this mode, all the error status is cleared.

#### DAMPING Mode

The gate driver is activated and outputs zero. Motor is in damping mode.

#### CALIBRATION Mode

The motor controller will execute the calibration sequence in the main loop.

After calibration, the motor controller will set itself in IDLE mode.

#### CURRENT Mode

Current closed-loop mode.

User sets `i_q_target` and `i_d_target` to control the motor.

#### TORQUE Mode

Torque closed-loop mode.

User sets `torque_target` to control the motor.

#### VELOCITY Mode

Velocity closed-loop mode.

User sets `velocity_target` to control the motor.

#### POSITION Mode

Position closed-loop mode.

User sets `position_target` to control the motor.

#### VABC\_OVERRIDE Mode

Open loop controlled V\_a, V\_b, V\_c.

User sets `v_a_setpoint`, `v_b_setpoint`, and `v_c_setpoint` to control the motor.

#### VALPHABETA\_OVERRIDE Mode

Open loop controlled V\_alpha and V\_beta.

User sets `v_alpha_setpoint` and `v_beta_setpoint` to control the motor.

#### VQD\_OVERRIDE Mode

Open loop controlled V\_d and V\_q.

User sets `v_d_target` and `v_q_target` to control the motor.

#### DEBUG Mode
