# Getting Started - STM32 Edition

Hi hi, this is -T.K.-.

Here's a text version of the STM32 tutorials (or lab notes).

The recommended getting started sequence is:

1. go through the articles in this "Getting Started" section in order, set up your environment and be able to run the hello world example program.&#x20;
2. then, you can go to the corresponding peripheral document sections that you need.
3. if there are any issues not specific for a peripheral, then probably it's in the "[Misc](../misc/)" section.
