**DISABLED Mode**

Gate driver is not activated. Motor is disabled, or in damping mode if hardware does not allow a total shutdown.

Any error in other mode will trigger the state machine to enter DISABLED mode. The error code can be seen in the error\_code register.

Switching from DISABLED mode to any other mode than IDLE is prohibited and will result in an error state.

**IDLE Mode**

The gate driver is activated and outputs zero or balanced output. Motor is in damping mode.

Upon entering this mode, all the error status is cleared.

**CALIBRATION Mode**

The motor controller will execute the calibration sequence in the main loop.

After calibration, the motor controller will be in IDLE mode.

**TORQUE Mode**

Torque closed-loop mode.

**VELOCITY Mode**

Velocity closed-loop mode.

**POSITION Mode**

Position closed-loop mode.

**OPEN\_IDQ Mode**

Open loop controlled I\_d and I\_q

**OPEN\_VDQ Mode**

Open loop controlled V\_d and V\_q

**OPEN\_VALPHABETA Mode**

Open loop controlled V\_alpha and V\_beta

**OPEN\_VABC Mode**

Open loop controlled V\_a, V\_b, V\_c
