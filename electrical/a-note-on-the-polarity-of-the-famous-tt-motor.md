# A Note on the Polarity of the Famous TT Motor

I’m using this article to record the polarity (direction) of the TT motor, which is commonly used in hobby models.

After some testing, we get the following relation between the motor and the wheel:

We define "positive" direction of the motor to be the counterclockwise rotation of the motor shaft when facing the motor shaft.

And thus, we can know that the “positive” lead of the motor is at the left side, when viewing from top to bottom
